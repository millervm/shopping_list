# Shopping List Ruby on Rails Application

# Overview

This Ruby on Rails application provides users with a content management system for shopping lists and items. Each user can create various lists, to which items can be added. Items can be categorized as "urgent", and they can be marked as complete to separate them from pending items. All lists and items can also be deleted. Overall, the application is intended for basic organization and tracking of list items.

# Usage

To use the application, clone the repository and run <code>rake db:migrate</code>. The application can be run by starting a Rails server.

Each user must first create an account, which requires a unique name and a password, in order to access the various features. Users can also log in with a Google account.
